    <h1><b><strong>Peoples' Prejudice Impressions that left marks and degradation on STEM Students</b></strong></h1>
    <h2></h2> There are <b>several circumstances</b> that anyone may quickly judge. It is known as identification or <b>initial impression</b>. A student is <b>considered</b> a STEM student if they <b>perform exceptionally</b> well in science and mathematics. The majority agreed with that because <b>society provided</b> the name of its community. The majority of individuals believe that they will recognize a student as a STEM student if they fall inside the STEM category, for example, if they excel in math or if math is their favorite subject. The problem is that <b>not everyone excels</b> in science and math. Not all excellent students in science and math are automatically placed in STEM; <b>others may belong to other strands.</b>
    <h2> <em>What is STEM?</em></h2>
    <h2></h2> <b> STEM </b>refers to <b>Science, Technology, Engineering</b> and<b> Math.</b> . It is a program of study intended to prepare elementary and secondary students for college, graduate school, and professions in these sectors. STEM education strives to promote intellectual curiosity, logical reasoning, and teamwork abilities in addition to subject-specific learning.
    <h2><em>What are the frequent courses aligned in STEM?</em></h2>
    <li><b>Medical Course </b>means any approved professional course in medicine, dentistry, nursing, pharmacy, para-medical or in any other system of medicine, which are recognized or approved under the respective Act governing that course; </li>
        &nbsp;
    <li><b>Engineering</b> problem-solving is at the heart of engineering. All of our constructed environment and infrastructure, communication tools, and manufacturing methods for our medications have been planned, put together, or overseen by engineers.
        Engineers can be seen building bridges, producing clean water systems, researching engine efficiency and alternative fuels, developing novel materials, advanced prosthetics, and more. Engineers employ math and science to accomplish remarkable feats and address some of the most difficult problems in the world, from satellites to cell membranes. </li>
        &nbsp;
        <li><b>Architecture</b> as opposed to construction-related abilities, is the art and technique of designing and building. Architecture is a discipline that satisfies both functional and expressive needs, and as a result, it serves both utilitarian and aesthetic goals.</li>
    <h2><b><em>Compare and contrast STEM in other strand</em></b></h2>
    <p>Students in senior high school offer <b>three tracks</b>: academic, technical-vocational-livelihood, and sports and the arts. There are <b>four strands</b> in the <b>academic track</b>: accounting, business, and management <b>( ABM );</b> general academic strand <b>( GAS )</b>; humanities and social sciences <b>( HUMSS )</b>; and science, technology, engineering, and mathematics <b>( STEM )</b>.</p>
    <h3><i><em>C O M P A R I S O N</em> </i></h3>
 
    <li> Strands <b>give students the chance </b>to comprehensively research and contemplate the courses they want to pursue in college.</li> 
    <li>Each of the listed strands can give <b>students knowledge</b> that will aid in their daily interactions.</li>
    <li>There may be <b>pressure on all </b>strands because of academics.</li>
    <h3><i><em>C O N T R A S T</em></i></h3>
    <li><b>Widely differing</b> emphasis subjects.</li>
    <li>The emphasis on advanced concepts and themes sets the STEM <b>curriculum apart</b> from the other strands and tracks.</li>
    <li>Based on the strand, <b>different courses</b> can be obtained.</li>
    <h2><b><em>What are the prevalent debates and problems in STEM?</em></b></h2>
    <li>Numerous people claim that STEM is <b>more challenging </b>than other strands since it involves both mathematics and science, which is one of the many reasons why students are hesitant to pursue this field.</li>
    <li>Another frequent problem is the perception that STEM is <b>better than other strands.</b> In schools, this prejudice can be apparent in circumstances like when STEM students are hired straight away when there is competition from other institutions.</li>
    <li>One of the major problems is how STEM students are <b>recognized;</b> if you prefer science and math, society will classify you as a STEM student.</li>
    <h2><b><em>How did this become an issue in STEM?</em></b></h2>
    <p>This <b>affects the performance</b> of STEM students, because these kinds of situations add pressure to students. There is pressure on oneself again, from family as well as teachers. Because as an individual belongs to STEM, it is expected that he is good or more advanced in the subjects, therefore the identity of the community is given to STEM students.</p>
    <h2><b><em>Issue's effect on STEM Students.</em></b></h2>
    <p>Because of these issues, it appears that the issue of STEM students is <b>adversely affected </b>when there are high expectations for their performance.</p>
    <li>Reason for <b>increasing </b>higher pressure</li>
    <li><b>Lacking s</b>elf-confidence</li>
    <li><b>Harming</b> mental well-being</li>
    <li>The <b>competition</b> among STEM students is highly competitive.</li>
    <li><b>Adverse</b> to academic success.</li>
    <h2><em>Steps to apprehend these types of circumstances :</em></h2>
    <li><b>Spreading awareness</b> helps others become aware of these kinds of problems.</li>
    <li><b>Healthy Competition</b> STEM students are aware that excessive competition can be unhealthy, thus by being aware of this issue, we can prevent toxic competition.</li>
    <li><b>Building each other's confidence</b> as STEM students, we are aware of the circumstances that can cause us to feel uneasy, therefore we can help one another by boosting our confidence</li>
